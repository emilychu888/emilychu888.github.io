					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I knew a bit about desigining for accessibility from the last article with typography and other things we learned in class. However, I didn't know there were specific legal implications in place for not having an accessible site. I also didn't know the icon for an error message was for accesibility specific purposes or even considering patterns to dileneate. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In all of these articles I like how they go into the importance of designing accessibly. I also really like all of the resources and links they put out. I specifically like seeing the comparison of pages and things that are designed for accessibility vs. not.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Not creating accessible products is just rude, so don’t be rude.”</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
