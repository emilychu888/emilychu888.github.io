                            <p> Something I learned from this article is the variety and diversity that animations and movement can add to user interactions. There's room for different shapes and transitions through every touchpoint with all of these examples from login pages, to shifting images, to selecting buttons.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article is that they were just the gifs/images with no explanation. I liked that it allowed you to focus on the different examples and also the range of the examples showed some creative ways for different purposes for each website or app.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> It's so hard to choose which one! But, I feel like some of my favorites were I liked the creativity and extra detail put into the nike one, espeically the application of the color way to the shoe and the drag across the screen being rainbow. I also liked the loading one for the send payment because I feel like that's a unique way to stall time for the user and make it interesting while they wait. Also using the color change for color coding priority in the email was a really useful application.  </p>
