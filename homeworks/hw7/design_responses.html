						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is the concept of Gestalt principles. I've heard the quote whole is perceived greater than sum of its parts before but didn't realize where it came from. Within the principles in this article I learned of the four key ideas of emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance. Within this I also learned how proximity, common region, similarity, closure, symmetry, continuation, and common fate apply in user interface design.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think my favorite part of the article is always the images that visually show how the different design concepts come into play. For instance, the initial 4 key ideas of gestalt, I liked seeing them in action with the icons like the dalmation and WWF logo and the perspective one which was completely new for me. I also liked the side by side differences in the different ways things like similarity or common region could be seen in the layout of a website. I feel like the examples in general that they used was good to see how it applies in logos or images we see commonly but don't realize it is drawing on those design ideas.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." </p>
