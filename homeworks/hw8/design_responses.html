				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned from this article is the dangers and the intentionality behind dark patterns/designs. The article goes over 11 different common types via Brignull's characterization including things like disguised ads, forced continuity, misdirection, and trick questions. I also did not know that LinkedIn had that lawsuit against them for partaking in some of these practices initially.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I was going to say my favorite part was going through and naming and calling out the different dark patterns, but actually I like the second half of the article the best. I think especially as a media studies major where we are looking and criticising media and its impact in the modern age I found the application and influence of these patterns within news and elections particularly intriguing. I also liked though that the end of the article mentions potential avenues for solutions or at least a framework to guide the ethics of design.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.‚Äù </p>
