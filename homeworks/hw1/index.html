            Hi! My name is Emily :) I'm originally from NJ (woo east coast!).
            I love to cook (especially for other people), run + do pilates, and participate in retail therapy. 
            When I'm not in class or in my apartment, you'll probably find me grocery shopping or studying at a cafe down College Ave.

                <li>The first thing I learned is to be more cognizant of the apps I'm using. 
                    The second is specifically to look at design concepts like hierarchy, content, intent, and audience when breaking down the app. </li>

                <li>My favorite part of the article were the breakdown gifs of the different apps. 
                    I feel like it helped to focus on certain aspects and their intentionality versus looking at it as a whole like we're used to.</li>

                <li>Quote I liked: "Know the rules, so you can break em"</li>

                <li>Solid 7/10. I feel like it was not too long, and the images made it interesting. 
                    I liked the tone being casual which made design and the tips more approachable and encouraging.</li>
